# 🦷 Dental Appointments EDA - Unveiling Patient Insights

This project explores a dental appointments dataset to extract valuable insights and patterns through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). We aim to understand patient demographics, appointment trends, treatment types, and more.

## 🚀 Project Overview

-   **Objective:** To perform EDA on the dental appointments dataset to gain a deeper understanding of patient data and trends.
-   **Tools:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib), Jupyter Notebook.

## 📂 Dataset Overview

The dataset provides comprehensive information about dental appointments. Key features include:

-   **Patient Name:** Name of the patient.
-   **Age:** Age of the patient.
-   **Gender:** Gender of the patient.
-   **Appointment Date:** Date of the scheduled appointment.
-   **Appointment Time:** Time of the scheduled appointment.
-   **Dentist:** Name of the dentist assigned to the appointment.
-   **Treatment Type:** Type of dental treatment scheduled.
-   **Cost ($):** Cost of the treatment.
-   **Status:** Status of the appointment (e.g., completed, canceled, no-show).

## 🛠️ Analysis Performed

### ✅ Explored Numerical Variables

Numerical features were analyzed to understand their distributions, central tendencies (mean, median), and dispersion (standard deviation). Outliers were identified and treated to prevent skewing the analysis.

### ✅ Explored Categorical Variables

Categorical variables were examined to determine the frequency of unique values and their relationships with other variables. This provided insights into patient demographics, treatment types, and appointment statuses.

### ✅ Found Relationships Between Features

Correlation analysis and other statistical methods were used to identify relationships and dependencies between features. This helped uncover patterns and potential predictive power.

## 📊 Key Findings & Insights

-   **Patient Demographics:** The majority of patients fall within the age range of **20-40 years**, indicating a younger patient base.
-   **Gender Distribution:** The dataset shows a slight female predominance in appointments, with a ratio of approximately **60% female to 40% male**.
-   **Appointment Trends:** Most appointments are scheduled during weekdays, with peak times observed in the late morning and early afternoon.
-   **Treatment Types:** The most common treatment types include **cleanings, fillings, and check-ups**, with varying costs associated with each.

## ❓ Specific Questions Addressed

1.  **High rate of no-shows:** We investigated the prevalence of no-show appointments and explored potential reasons (e.g., reminders, scheduling conflicts).
2.  **Cost analysis of treatments:** Analyzed the distribution of treatment costs and identified any significant outliers or trends.
3.  **Age group preferences:** Examined the relationship between age groups and preferred treatment types.
4.  **Appointment cancellations:** Analyzed the reasons behind appointment cancellations and their frequency.
5.  **Dentist performance:** Evaluated the performance of different dentists based on appointment completion rates and patient feedback.

## ▶️️ How to Run the Analysis

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/VivekBalmiki/Dental-Appointments-EDA.git
    cd Dental-Appointments-EDA
    ```
2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib jupyter
    ```
3.  **Open Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
4.  **Run the Notebook:** Open and execute the `Dental_Appointments_EDA.ipynb` notebook.

## 📊 Visualization & Future Work

-   **Patient Demographics Analysis:** Conduct in-depth analysis on patient demographics, including age and gender distributions.
-   **Treatment Cost Analysis:** Develop visualizations to compare treatment costs and their impact on appointment status.
-   **Predictive Modeling:** Explore the possibility of building predictive models to forecast appointment no-shows or cancellations.
-   **Time Series Analysis:** Analyze appointment trends over time to identify seasonal patterns or changes in patient behavior.
